The data available in file SamsungWearableAverageMeanSTD.txt is derived from accelerometer and gyroscope readings taken from Samsung galaxy smartphone, provided by 30 volunteers.
The full details of the base data used to derive this file is available at the following URL
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

This particular data set used only the mean and standard deviation measures among the 561 time and frequency domain variable provided in the base data.
The data finally derived is an average of the mean and standard deviation variables provided in the base data, for each of the subject and type of activity they did
There are 30 participants and 6  activities , therefore the derived file contains 180 derived observations.
The final data set also displays the label of activity and the subject identifier in each of the rows derived.

The variables preserve the base data set names, except for the prefix of "Avg." to indicate that this is an average and not raw readings from base data.

As explained in the base data documentation, the measure consists of time domain and frequency domain acceleration, jerk and angular velocity mesaurements
Variables with prefix of "Avg. t" are time domain and those with "Avg. f" are frequency domain measurements.
Unit of acceleration is g , unit of angular velocity is radians/s and unit of jerk is m/seconds^3.
Those measurements from gyro are angular velocity.
Those measurements along X,Y,X axis are shown, magnitude is the magnitude of measurement across all directions
Those with mean in the name indicates the base observation was mean and std indicates the base measurement as standard deviation
